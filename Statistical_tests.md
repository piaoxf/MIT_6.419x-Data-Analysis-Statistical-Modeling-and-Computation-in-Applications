## Fisher's Exact Test

Fisher's Exact Test provides a method based on the hypergeometric distribution to test hypotheses of the form:

- 𝐻0:𝜋treatment=𝜋control , i.e. treatment has no effect on the rate of occurence of a targeted outcome

- 𝐻𝐴:𝜋 treatment<𝜋control , i.e. treatment lowers (or raises, or changes) the rate of occurence of a targeted outcome.

## t-test
The t-test is a statistical method to test a hypothesis without knowing the population standard deviation  𝜎 . Instead, we can estimate  𝜎  using the sample standard deviation formula, based on the observations  𝑋1,𝑋2,…,𝑋𝑛 , where  𝑋⎯⎯⎯  is the sample mean.

The  𝑡-statistic is computed similarly to the  𝑧-statistic, except that we substitute a known population variance  𝜎 , which does not exist in this setting with the sample variance  𝜎^2.

Under the assumption that  𝑋1,𝑋2,…,𝑋𝑛∼𝑖.𝑖.𝑑(𝜇,𝜎2)  for any pair of parameters  (𝜇,𝜎2) ,  𝑇  is a pivotal statistic. Its distribution is called a  𝑡 -distribution and is parametrized by the number of degrees of freedom. In this case,  𝑇∼𝑡𝑛−1 , the  𝑡  distribution with  𝑛−1  degrees of freedom.

## Wilcoxon singed rank test
Assume distribution is symmetrical around the mean
