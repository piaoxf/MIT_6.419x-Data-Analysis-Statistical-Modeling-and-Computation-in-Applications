### Stefanie Jegelka
Professor Jegelka is an X-Consortium Career Development Associate Professor at the department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS).
Her research is in algorithmic machine learning, and spans modeling, optimization algorithms, theory and applications. In particular, she has been working on exploiting mathematical structure for discrete and combinatorial machine learning problems, for robustness and for scaling machine learning algorithms.
Her research is supported by a Sloan Research Fellowship, an NSF CAREER Award, a DARPA Young Faculty Award, an NSF BIGDATA, an Adobe Research award, an STL award and other awards by NSF and DARPA. Previously, she was also supported by a Google Research Award and an MIT RSC award.

### Caroline Uhler
Caroline Uhler is a Henry L. and Grace Doherty Associate Professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS).
Her research focuses on mathematical statistics and computational biology, in particular on graphical models, causal inference and algebraic statistics, and on applications to learning gene regulatory networks and the development of geometric models for the organization of chromosomes.
She is an elected member of the International Statistical Institute and she is the recipient of a Sloan Research Fellowship, an NSF Career Award, a Sofja Kovalevskaja Award from the Humboldt Foundation, and a START Award from the Austrian Science Fund.
