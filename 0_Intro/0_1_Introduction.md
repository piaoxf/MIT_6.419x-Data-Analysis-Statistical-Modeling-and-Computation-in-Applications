# 1. Introduction

Welcome to Data Analysis: Statistical Modeling and Computation in Applications.

This course is a hands-on data analysis course that introduces the interplay between statistics and computation for the analysis of real data.

This course consists of an introduction (Module 0) and four modules (Modules 1-4). The introduction reviews some common statistical tools such as hypothesis tests, regression, and gradient descent methods. Each of the following 4 modules is centered around a specific type of data:

- Genomics and high-dimensional data

- Criminal networks and network analysis

- Prices, economics and time series

- Environmental Data and Spatial Statistics

Each module will include an analysis that will guide you to analyze a real data set from the domain of focus. In each homework, you will be required to demonstrate your mathematical and statistical knowledge, as well as your critical thinking, data analytic techniques, and communication skills in 3 graded components:

- Autograded problems

- Written report

- Peer Review

The breakdown of the grades will be detailed in the grading policy section.

At the end of this class, you will be able to do the following:

- Model, form hypotheses, perform statistical analysis on real data .

- Use dimension reduction techniques such as principal component analysis , t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding to visualize high-dimensional data and apply this to genomics data.

- Analyze networks (e.g. social networks) and use centrality measures to describe the importance of nodes, and apply this to criminal networks .

- Model time series using moving average, autoregressive and other stationary models for forecasting with financial data.

- Use Gaussian processes to model environmental data and make predictions.

- Communicate analysis results effectively.
