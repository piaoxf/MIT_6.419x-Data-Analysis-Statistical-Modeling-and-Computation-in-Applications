# 5. Grading policy

Your overall score in this class will be a weighted average of your scores for the three different components, with the following weights:

- 32% for the lecture exercises (divided equally among the 16 out of 18 lectures)
- 20% for the Analysis Part A (divided equally among 4 (out of 5))
- 48% for the Written Analysis (divided equally among 4 (out of 5))

Each written analysis is then further subdivided into 3 components, with the following weighting:
- 70% Written report; scores received from peer grading.
- 20% Completion of peer grading
- 10% Valuable comments made during peer grading or in the optional open discussion, as chosen by peers.

You will have a chance go through the process of submitting a written report, reviewing peer reports, and choosing valuable comments in the Practice Report section later.

_Note that there will no final exam in this course._

To earn a verified certificate for this course, you will need to obtain an overall score of 60% or more of the maximum possible overall score.

Lowest Score Dropped as Sickness/Contingency Policy

- The lowest 2 scores among the 18 lectures will be dropped, so only 16 out of 18 lectures will count .

- The lowest score among the 5 part A analyses will be dropped, so only 4 out of 5 part A analyses will count .

- The lowest score among the 5 written analyses will be dropped, so only 4 out of 5 written analyses will count .

Note that not every lecture or analysis will have the same number of raw points. For example, lecture 1 may have 13 points and lecture 2 may have 18 points. However, each one receives the same weight for the purposes of calculating your overall score.

As an illustrative example, if you receive 10 points out of 13 on lecture 1, this will contribute  1013⋅32%16≈1.54%  to your overall score. Similarly, if you receive 12 points out of 18 on lecture 2, this will contribute  1218⋅32%16≈1.33%  to your overall score.

Under the “Progress" tab at the top, you can see your score broken down for each assignment, as well as a summary plot.

The policy of dropping the lowest scores from each component is to accommodate for scheduling conflict, illness, or events which might deter you from completing the work before the deadline with the best grades you can. However, we still fully expect you to learn the material for any dropped assignments, and the quizs will cover everything.

Verified/Audit Access: Audit and verified learners will both have access to all learning materials, including all lecture videos and exercises, recitations, and analyses.

However, only verified learners will be eligible to receive a certificate for the course, which counts towards the data analysis component of the Micromasters Program in Statistics and Data Science.
