# 2. Prerequisites

This course is intended as the final course in the MicroMasters Program in Statistics and Data Science, but open to all students with appropriate prerequisites. You are expected, and strongly encouraged, to have taken:

- 6.431x Probability–the Science of Uncertainty and Data Science or equivalent

- 18.6501x Fundamentals of Statistics

- 6.86x Machine Learning with Python–From Linear Models to Deep Learning

- Python Programming, such as 6.00.1x Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python, and 6.00.2x Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science

- Calculus, such as Xseries Program in 18.01x Single Variable Calculus and Multivariable Calculus

- Linear Algebra, such as 18.06 Linear Algebra on MIT Open Courseware

In particular, topics we expect you to be familiar with include:

- Matrix and vector multiplication

- Eigenvectors and eigenvalues

- Basic distributions

- Conditional distributions

- Variance/covariance

- Multivariate Gaussians

- Computing derivatives and Hessian of multivariate functions

- At least one programming language (e.g., Python).

In past experience on the MIT campus, most students who struggled had problems with linear algebra or programming.
