# Linear Algebraic Preparations

We will start with some linear algebra exercises before continuing with the lecture.

At the end of this series of exercises, you will be able to:

- Compute the expectation and covariance matrix of a random vector.

- Compute the empirical mean and empirical covariance matrix of a vector data set.

- Compute the variance in a given direction of a random vector.

- Compute the empirical variance in a given direction of a vector-valued sample.

- Describe the fundamental properties of projection matrices .

- State the decomposition theorem for symmetric matrices.

Note: These exercises were optional in the final ungraded unit on Principal Component Analysis in the course Fundamentals of Statistics. They are graded here. We encourage you to work on these again as a refresher.
